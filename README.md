## âœ¨ Summary
BioLED Controller is a modern, space-efficient and user-friendly Windows application designed to control **Mightex BioLED light modules** (e.g., BLS-series) for use in laboratory and microscopy environments. Developed using **C# and WPF**, the application prioritizes UI simplicity, compact design, and hardware integration via both **DLL-based SDKs** and **custom Arduino interfaces**.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Key Features
- âœ… **Compact UX**: Uses only 2â€“9% of screen real estate compared to 19% for Mightexâ€™s original controller.
- ðŸŽ¨ **Modern Material Design UI**: Implemented using [MaterialDesignInXAML Toolkit](https://github.com/MaterialDesignInXAML).
- ðŸŒ“ **Dark Mode Support**: Designed for light-sensitive lab environments.
- ðŸ“¦ **Resizability**: Scales from full UI to ultra-compact mode without losing functionality.
- ðŸ”Œ **Hardware Integration**:
  - Direct control of BLS-series devices via `Mightex_BLSDriver_SDK.dll`.
  - Serial communication to custom Arduino hardware for additional controls.
